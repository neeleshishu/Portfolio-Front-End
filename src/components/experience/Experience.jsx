                                For the last 2 years, I am working on web development.
                                Currently working as an intern at Kaizen Young Consultant, Pune.
                                KYC helps all businesses not only reach but exceed their goals.
                                For the last 6 months, I am working with KYC as a web developer intern and
                                have working on many projects, dealing with clients, and working as a team.
                                KYC helps me to improve my skills and increase my potential.
